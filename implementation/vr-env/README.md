VR Test Environment
===================

Simple virtual environment, filled with sound sources, used to test the individualiser module. 

More docs to come post-refactor. 

My example environment is contained in Individualiser Frontend, while the Scripts directory contains a couple of example scripts that will transmit and fetch vector data from the individualiser module running on the remote.
