Implementation
==============

This folder contains three main components: 

1. Python program that performs the principle components analysis, individualisation and reconstruction processes. 

2. VR environment for testing and generating the data that will feed into the Python module. 

3. WebVR environment that was pursued for a little while before going with another plan
