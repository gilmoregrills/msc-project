abstract = {This dissertation develops and evaluates a novel way of modeling and estimating individualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) from a priori information and a limited number of acoustic measurements. Head-related transfer functions represent and describe the acoustic transformations caused by interactions of sound with a listener's head, shoulders, and outer ears which give a sound its directional characteristics. Once this transformation is measured, it can be combined with any non-directional sound to give a listener the per- ceptual illusion that the sound originated from a designated location in space. The ability to manipulate these spatial auditory cues has many applications for both immersive and informational spatial auditory displays (SADs). Unfortunately, high delity SADs require the use of individualized head-related transfer functions that are measured for the speci c end user of the spatial auditory display. These measurements are typically impractical for widespread commercialization, in large part because traditional HRTF measurement tech- niques require several hundred spatial locations to be measured around a listener, a procedure which requires expensive and complicated equipment, and which can take upwards of two hours. This dissertation introduces a novel way to represent a spatially continuous HRTF with a relatively small number of parameters via a spherical harmonic decomposition. This rep- resentation is shown to be perceptually equivalent to a full HRTF in terms of the resulting localization accuracy, while providing a convenient form for making HRTF comparisons across individuals and spatial locations. With this new framework it is shown that HRTFs from a large group of individuals can be modeled e ectively with a multivariate normal dis- tribution, and that this underlying distribution can be used to provide a priori information for individualized HRTF estimation allowing accurate estimates from as few as 12 spatially distributed locations. The new representation is also shown to be particularly well suited for the separation of individual and non-individual components of the HRTF. Analysis of the underlying distribu- tions characterizing the HRTF, as well as perceptual evidence, indicates that only the spatial variation in an HRTF which corresponds to the vertical and front-back dimensions of a sound source location need to be individualized. This nding forms the basis of what is referred to as the sectoral HRTF model. The sectoral HRTF model is shown to be valid in terms of localization accuracy and provides a way to capture the individual components in an HRTF with only nine parameters at a single frequency. The relationship between these parameters and the spatial variance along the vertical and front-back dimensions is also exploited to allow relatively accurate HRTF estimation from acoustic measurements that are limited to a single plane. Together, these developments provide signi cant advancements in the ease with which individualized HRTFs are collected, as well as a wealth of new information relvent to ecient HRTF modeling.},

In spatial sound simulations, partial models, such as the spherical head model, can also generate simple and effective approximate localization cues. We consider the composition of an approximate HRTF from the responses of structural components by making use of detailed measurements of isolated pinnae and of a pinna-less head and torso. We determine that such a composition is sensitive to additional geometric parameters that can be obtained from anthropometry. We show that, with such parameters, simple composition rules can produce a good correspondence between measured and composite HRTFs},

Some important anthropometric parameters are selected by Laplacian score and correlation analysis between all measured parameters and the individual core tensor. They act as the inputs of the personalization model. Then a nonlinear model is constructed based on radial basis function (RBF) neural network to predict individual HRTFs according to the measured anthropometric parameters.

abstract = {Pole-zero approximations of human free-field-to-eardrum transfer functions-i.e., head-related transfer functions (HRTFs)-can be used to synthesize binaural acoustic fields over headphones with fewer parameters, and therefore, lower computational complexity than is typically achieved by all-zero approximations. While standard pole-zero designs minimize the squared difference between the desired and designed frequency responses, the synthesis of binaural acoustic fields is more likely to be sensitive to relative, rather than absolute, differences in the HRTF approximations. The paper proposes a new design algorithm that minimizes an error criterion based on complex logarithms. As a result, both log-magnitude and phase errors are minimized. Slight modifications to the proposed algorithm result in one for which the phase error can be ignored. A comparison of this modified algorithm to others that have been developed to minimize the log-magnitude error shows implementation advantages without sacrificing performance. In achieving comparable errors, application of the proposed algorithm to the HRTF approximation results in pole-zero model orders smaller than those required for approximating the HRTFs using a least-squares error criterion},

abstract = {We present a new anthropometry-based method to personalize head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) using manifold learning in both azimuth and elevation angles with a single nonlinear regression model. The core element of our approach is a domain-specific nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, denominated Isomap, over the intraconic component of HRTFs resulting from a spectral decomposition. HRTF intraconic components encode the most important cues for HRTF individualization, leaving out subject-independent cues. First, we modify the graph construction procedure of Isomap to integrate relevant prior knowledge of spatial audio into a single manifold for all subjects by exploiting the existing correlations among HRTFs across individuals, directions, and ears. Then, with the aim of preserving the multifactor nature of HRTFs (i.e. subject, direction and frequency), we train a single artificial neural network to predict low-dimensional HRTFs from anthropometric features. Finally, we reconstruct the HRTF from its estimated low-dimensional version using a neighborhood-based reconstruction approach. Our findings show that introducing prior knowledge in Isomap's manifold is a powerful way to capture the underlying factors of spatial hearing. Our experiments show, with p-values less than 0.05, that our approach outperforms using, either a PCA linear reduction, or the full HTRF, in its intermediate stages},

abstract = {Logic's basic elements are unfolded in this book. The relation of and the transition from Logic to Logic Programming are analysed. With the use and the development of computers in the beginning of the 1950's, it soon became clear that computers could be used, not only for arithmetical computation, but also for symbolic computation. Hence, the first arithmetical computation programs, and the first programs created to answer elementary questions and prove simple theorems, were written simultaneously. The basic steps towards a general method based on Logic, were accomplished in 1965 by Robinson and later by Kowalski and Colmerauer who made use of Logic directly as a Logic Programming language. Each chapter includes solved as well as unsolved exercises provided to help the reader assimilate the corresponding topics. The solved exercises demonstrate how to work methodically, whereas the unsolved exercises aim to stimulate the reader's personal initiative. The contents of the book are self-contained; only an elementary knowledge of analysis is required. Thus, it can be used by students in every academic year, as simply reading material, or in the context of a course. It can also be used by those who utilize Logic Programming without having any particular theoretical background knowledge of Logic, or by those simply interested in Logic and its applications in Logic Programming.},

abstract = {All software construction involves essential tasks, the fashioning of the complex conceptual structures that compose the abstract software entity, and accidental tasks, the representation of these abstract entities in programming languages and the mapping of these onto machine languages within space and speed constraints. Most of the big past gains in software productivity have come from removing artificial barriers that have made the accidental tasks inordinately hard, such as severe hardware constraints, awkward programming languages, lack of machine time. How much of what software engineers now do is still devoted to the accidental, as opposed to the essential? Unless it is more than 9/10 of all effort, shrinking all the accidental activities to zero time will not give an order of magnitude improvement. Therefore it appears that the time has come to address the essential parts of the software task, those concerned with fashioning abstract conceptual structures of great complexity. I suggest: • Exploiting the mass market to avoid constructing what can be bought. • Using rapid prototyping as part of a planned iteration in establishing software requirements. • Growing software organically, adding more and more function to systems as they are run, used, and tested. • Identifying and developing the great conceptual designers of the rising generation.

To avoid costly measurements a physical model of HRTFs has been developed considering the influence of a few acoustically relevant objects. Individual variations of HRTFs correspond to variations of geometrical parameters. In a first step, the head has been modeled by a rigid sphere and the pinna with cavum conchae by elliptical disks; the position of the ear reference point is one of the most important parameters. The correlation between calculated and measured HRTFs is significantly higher if the influence of shoulder/torso is modeled by an additional rigid sphere. In a second step, the shapes of head and shoulder/torso have been approximated with oblate respective prolate spheroids in order to get even better results. Sound field calculations have been performed using the boundary element method and analytical methods (solution of the wave equation, use of Huygens' integral formula). Computation time has been reduced by a factor of about 100 using and optimizing the source simulation technique for the diffraction problem of spheroids.},

Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) based sound rendering techniques, which seek to create a realistic virtual auditory space for listeners, have become a prominent concept in human robot interaction. Applications that demand high quality 3D sound synthesis are usually based on measured HRTFs of listeners. Recently, researchers propose to construct a set of personalized HRTFs using multiple linear regression models between anthropometric data and measured HRTFs, which implies the existence of a training HRTF dataset together with the corresponding anthropometric data. This paper focuses on the measurement of Head-Related transfer Functions (HRTFs) and the corresponding anthropometric data of a listener. Several state-of-the-art techniques of measuring the HRTFs are described. For measuring the anthropometric data, we develop a low budget approach, which enables us to measure the anthropometry of a person within short time at a high accuracy, whereas the hardware costs for the scanning system are significantly reduced.},

" Tan and Gan [Tan98] continued Myers work and implemented a set of parallel ﬁlters based on ﬁve frequency regions (f1: 225-680 Hz, f2: 680-2000 Hz, f3: 2-6.3 kHz, f4: 6.3-10.9 kHz, f5: 10.9-22 kHz). For frontal localization f1, f3 and f5 were ampliﬁed whereas f2 and f4 were attenuated for backward perception. However, they did not describe the full experiment and statistical analysis." - useful for film/vg stuff (page 8)


"Kulkarni and Colburn mentioned that a smoothing of the HRTFs by reducing the Fourier coeﬃcients in the reconstruction of the magnitude spectrum did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect localizationperformance, evenwhenthecoeﬃcientswerereducedfrom256to16[KC98]. Furthermore, in a test focusing on azimuth location, all subjects reported complete externalization of the sound stimuli." - page 9, not entirely sure I understand it but it seems important. 


Minimum Phase definition from Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum{\_}phase:  In control theory and signal processing, a linear, time-invariant system is said to be minimum-phase if the system and its inverse are causal and stable.


"HRTFs are usually decomposed into a directional and a non-directional part, which are called Directional transfer function (DTF) and Common transfer function (CTF) or Average transfer function (ATF) [LB02], respectively." - page 10


So an HRTF can be decomposed into directional and non-directional by first calculating the CTF, then subtracting that from the HRTF


"we can be gradually accustomed over time to HRTFs others than our ones [Bla83]." - page 10


"A large number of methods to model HRTFs have been proposed. These can be categorized in signal models, anthropometric models and orthogonal basis function expansions" - page 12 then goes on to explain the models


"Wenzel et al. [Wen88] found a relationship between a listeners accuracy in vertical localization and the characteristics of a listeners external ears" - page 14 this could help if I go down the route of adapting the hrtfs based on localization errors


"Some studies ([BD98], [XLZ07]) investigated the importance of various anatomical structures in relation to sound localization." - page 14 these studies could help me work out what I need to focus on


On numerical models: "Currently, there are still issues to measure the pinna accurately. Even small deviations in measurement can cause large errors in modelling. However, if there is a precise measurement, this approach can have good results [Sot99]. " - page 14 - so this is a reason why a numerical model for hrtf personalization won't work based on my requirement that the system be based on simple input. A process that breaks should a user measure SLIGHTLY incorrectly would be bad in that case


Successfully decomposed hrtfs into three features: "Raykar et al. [RDD03] decomposed the HRTF into diﬀerent components and extracted features that could be perceptually relevant for sound source localization. By relating these features to the anthropometry, it could be possible to model HRTFs for any subject and source position. Linear prediction (LP) analysis was applied to extract the poles of the HRIR. For any given azimuth, a 2D image (HRIR or HRTF) of all elevations was calculated from the CIPIC database. Three distinct features could be marked by visual inspection: ITD with head diﬀraction with pinna eﬀects, torso reﬂections and knee reﬂections since the subject were measured seated. In order to isolate various spectral peaks and notches, poles were extracted by Linear Prediction Analysis (LP). These poles correspond to the resonances of the pinna. The results were in agreement of the thesis by Shaw [Sha97] describing six modes of resonance" - page 15


to read: "Martens [Mar87] presented a model that is based on PCA and minimum-phase reconstruction." - page 16


"Kistler and Wightman [KW92] analyzed HRTFs of 10 subjects using PCA and showed that more than 90{\%} of HRTF variance can be approximated with only 5 of 150 basis spectral functions." - page 16 - familiarise self with rest of this passage because it seems key


"The ﬁrst principal component therefore contains most of the interaural intensity information necessary for lateral discrimination. Front-back and up-down performance dramatically decreased when using less than ﬁve PCs." - page 16 - useful to know


"A high correlation between the two diﬀerent sets of basis vectors was found (PC1: 96{\%}, PC2: 88{\%}, PC3: 70{\%}). This reveals that PCA is relatively robust to diﬀerent measurement techniques" - page 17 - meaning that applying PCA to my own hrtfs should result in similar results to these researchers? 


"Prior to experiment, an HRTF customization procedure has been applied, because non-individualized HRTF sets were used." - READ THIS PAPER, Qian and Eddins


"For seven of nine subjects there was no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between using measured or customized HRIRs. Contrary, localization performance for all probands increased when using individual instead of KEMAR HRIRs." - page 18 - customized hrtfs can be as good as measured ones, individual hrtfs are better than KEMAR


"To use the powerful mechanism of component decomposition, several individualization techniques based on PCA were established. By subjective adjustment of the component weights, localization performance could be signiﬁcantly increased. In Section 4, fundamental studies are presented." - page23 - If manual, subjective, adjustment of the component weights can yield improved results, then

abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and pinna reflection patterns in the frontal hemispace. A pre-processed database of HRTFs allows extraction of up to three spectral notches from each response taken in the median sagittal plane. Ray-tracing analysis performed on the obtained notches' central frequencies is compared with a set of possible reflection surfaces directly recognizeable from the corresponding pinna picture. Results of such analysis are discussed in terms of the reflection coefficient sign, which is found to be most likely negative. Based on this finding, a model for real-time HRTF synthesis that allows to control separately the evolution of different acoustic phenomena such as head diffraction, ear resonances, and reflections is proposed through the design of distinct filter blocks. Parameters to be fed to the model are derived either from analysis or from specific anthropometric features of the subject. Finally, objective evaluations of reconstructed HRTFs in the chosen spatial range are performed through spectral distortion measurements.},

These transformations, which primarily result from the interaction of the acoustic wave with the complex geometry of the head and pinna, are known to be the principal determinants of source location. It is especially known that the interaural time differences (ITDs) are encoded by the phase spectra of the HRTFs at the two ears. In this study we explore a model of the HRTF which approximates the HRTF as a minimum phase function. The model is tested both theoretically and through psychophysical experiments.

Conclusion:
"We proposed a method for HRTF phase frequency response synthesis using anthropometric features and sparse representation. The phase frequency response is modeled as average ITD, function of the direction and elevation, scaled accordingly to the subject's personal ITD, which depends on the subject's anthropometric features. The anthropometric features of a given subject are presented as a sparse linear combination of the anthropometric features of the subjects in the dataset, and then the same relation is used to estimate the ITD scaling factor and thereby synthesize a personalized set of HRTF phases. The root mean square error conﬁrms the effectiveness of the sparse representation based approach. Our method shows lower error than all other evaluated techniques and obtains results closest to the best classiﬁer (i.e. the nearest ITD scaling factor in the training set). Future work includes combining the magnitude and phase estimation methods, determining a perceptually motivated distance measure, and validating the synthesized HRTFs in a perceptual experiment."},
