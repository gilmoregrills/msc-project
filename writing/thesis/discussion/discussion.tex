\begin{itemize}

\item Does the algorithm work? (noting flaws)
\begin{itemize}
\item If no, why not, what could have made it work? 
\item If yes, how could it be improved? 
\end{itemize}

\item *elisa from hamilton voice* what would I have done if I'd only had time?
\item what was out of scope for this project, but would be an interesting extension of this? collating more Error/PC data and using it to train an ANN or other more interesting ML model? how could anything, if anything, be applied to future stuff
\end{itemize}
