Based on the research outlined in the previous chapter, it was decided that an initial implementation of the proposed process would involve modelling the HRTF using principal components analysis to reduce limit the number of variables in play to those that contain the greatest variance. Modifications to this reduced dataset would then be made based on simulated annealing search - or some variation of it. The efficacy of this implementation of this proposed approach will then be evaluated through listening tests conducted within a simple virtual reality environment. The metric for success is the same as the heuristic being used in the individualisation process - does the participant's ability to localise sound sources get better over time, and if so by how much?

\subsubsection{Implementation}

it is worth noting that my proposed search method is essentially running many individual searches - either in sequence or in parallel - in order to find the optimal value for *every source position*
