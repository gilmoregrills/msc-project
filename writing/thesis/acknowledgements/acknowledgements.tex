\noindent
I would like to acknowledge a number of people whose input on this project, direct or indirect, helped shape the final outcome. Whether successful or otherwise, this work has taught me so much, and I will forever be indebted to those who helped me complete it.

\bigskip
\noindent
My supervisor, Dr Rebecca Stewart, without whose patience in the face of panicked emails and expertise in the subject area I fear I would have scuttled this project very quickly. 

\bigskip
\noindent
To my family, for listening to me freak out at various points, and letting me cancel on them so I could work some more.

\bigskip
\noindent
Abigail, for everything. But above all else for being chill as hell. 

\bigskip
\noindent
Nix, Jake, Pottsy, Roxy, Pancake, Ash, Sam, Forrest and Holden. For encouraging and supporting me, keeping me sane, and ensuring I had at least some remote contact with humans on days when I was at my desk from dawn 'til long past dusk. I love you all. 

\bigskip
\noindent	
Ruby, even if you were mostly a hindrance your proof-reading was pretty good so that cancels it out probably. Thanks pal.

\noindent
Lastly, to all of the friends that I've neglected over the past year. We cool? Cool.
