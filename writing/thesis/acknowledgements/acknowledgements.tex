\noindent
I would like to acknowledge a number of people whose input on this project, whether direct or not, helped shape the final outcome. Whether successful or otherwise, this work has taught me so much, and I will forever be indebted to those who helped me complete it.

\bigskip
\noindent
My supervisor, Dr Rebecca Stewart, without whose patience in the face of panicked emails and expertise in the subject area I fear I would have scuttled this project very quickly. 

\bigskip
\noindent
Both of my parents, for listening to me freak out at various points, and letting me cancel on them so I could work some more.

\bigskip
\noindent
My internet family: Nix, Jake, Pottsy, Roxy, Pancake, Ash, Sam, Forrest and Holden. Thank you for encouraging and supporting me, keeping me sane, and ensuring I had at least some remote contact with humans on days when I was at my desk from dawn 'til dusk.

\bigskip
\noindent
Ruby, here's your acknowledgement, even if you were mostly a hindrance your proof reading was pretty useful I guess. 

\bigskip 
\noindent
Lastly, all the friends that I've neglected over the past year. We cool? Cool.
