I would like to acknowledge a number of people whose input on this project, whether directly applied or by proxy, helped shape the final outcome. Whether successful or otherwise, this work has taught me so much, and I will forever be indebted to those who helped me complete it.
\begin{itemize}

\item My supervisor, Dr Rebecca Stewart, without whose patience in the face of panicked emails and expertise in the subject area I fear I would have scuttled this project very quickly. 

\item All of my coursemates, for the myriad ways you've all helped over this past year and for dragging me out to socialise on occasion.

\item My parents both for listening to me freak out at various points, and letting me cancel on them so I could work more. 

\item My internet family: Nix, Jake, Pottsy, Roxy, Pancake, Ash, Sam, Forrest and Holden. Thank you for encouraging and supporting me, keeping me sane, and ensuring I had at least some human contact on days when I was at my desk from dawn 'til dusk.
 
\item Lastly, to all the friends that I've neglected - We cool? Cool.
\end{itemize}
