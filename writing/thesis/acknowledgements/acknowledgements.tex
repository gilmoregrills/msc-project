Becky, obvs
Both of my parents, for both listening to me freak out at various points, and being cancelled on so I could work more
I guess abigail? for patiently listening to me explain stuff she didn't care about and handling the breakup in the chillest way possible so as not to distract
to my found-internet-family, [names] that make up You Know... ;) Episode II: Attack Of The Clones for encouraging and supporting me, keeping me sane, and ensuring I at least had some remote human contact, even on days when I was tied to my desk from dawn 'til long past dusk, I can't wait to come to the US and smooch you all
to my coursemates, for dragging me out to socialise on occasion
to steam/github user Lanion for helping out with a tough implementation detail and getting excited about the idea when I hated it the most 
and lastly to all the friends I've neglected, we cool? Cool.
