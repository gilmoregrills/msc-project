abstract = {A tensor is used to describe head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) dependent on frequencies, sound directions and anthropometric parameters. It can represent the multi-dimensional structure of measured HRTFs. To construct a personalization model, high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is firstly applied to extract individual core tensor as the outputs of the model. Some important anthropometric parameters are selected by Laplacian score and correlation analysis between all measured parameters and the individual core tensor. They act as the inputs of the personalization model. Then a nonlinear model is constructed based on radial basis function (RBF) neural network to predict individual HRTFs according to the measured anthropometric parameters. Compared with back-propagation (BP) neural network method, simulation results demonstrate the better performance for predicting individual HRTFs in the midsaggital plane at high elevations.},

@article{Romigh2012a,
abstract = {This dissertation develops and evaluates a novel way of modeling and estimating individ- ualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) from a priori information and a limited number of acoustic measurements. Head-related transfer functions represent and describe the acoustic transformations caused by interactions of sound with a listener's head, shoulders, and outer ears which give a sound its directional characteristics. Once this transformation is measured, it can be combined with any non-directional sound to give a listener the per- ceptual illusion that the sound originated from a designated location in space. The ability to manipulate these spatial auditory cues has many applications for both immersive and informational spatial auditory displays (SADs). Unfortunately, high delity SADs require the use of individualized head-related transfer functions that are measured for the speci c end user of the spatial auditory display. These measurements are typically impractical for widespread commercialization, in large part because traditional HRTF measurement tech- niques require several hundred spatial locations to be measured around a listener, a procedure which requires expensive and complicated equipment, and which can take upwards of two hours. This dissertation introduces a novel way to represent a spatially continuous HRTF with a relatively small number of parameters via a spherical harmonic decomposition. This rep- resentation is shown to be perceptually equivalent to a full HRTF in terms of the resulting localization accuracy, while providing a convenient form for making HRTF comparisons across individuals and spatial locations. With this new framework it is shown that HRTFs from a large group of individuals can be modeled e ectively with a multivariate normal dis- tribution, and that this underlying distribution can be used to provide a priori information for individualized HRTF estimation allowing accurate estimates from as few as 12 spatially distributed locations. The new representation is also shown to be particularly well suited for the separation of individual and non-individual components of the HRTF. Analysis of the underlying distribu- tions characterizing the HRTF, as well as perceptual evidence, indicates that only the spatial variation in an HRTF which corresponds to the vertical and front-back dimensions of a sound source location need to be individualized. This nding forms the basis of what is referred to as the sectoral HRTF model. The sectoral HRTF model is shown to be valid in terms of localization accuracy and provides a way to capture the individual components in an HRTF with only nine parameters at a single frequency. The relationship between these parameters and the spatial variance along the vertical and front-back dimensions is also exploited to allow relatively accurate HRTF estimation from acoustic measurements that are limited to a single plane. Together, these developments provide signi cant advancements in the ease with which individualized HRTFs are collected, as well as a wealth of new information relvent to ecient HRTF modeling.},

abstract = {This study examined inter-subject differences in the transfer functions from the free field to the human ear canal, which are commonly know as head-related transfer functions. The directional components of such transfer functions are referred here to as directional transfer functions (DTFs). The DTFs of 45 subjects varied systematically among subjects in regard to the frequencies of spectral features such as peaks and notches. Inter-subject spectral differences in DTFs were quantified between 3.7 and 12.9 kHz for sound-source directions throughout the coordinate sphere. For each pair of subjects, an optimal frequency scale factor aligned spectral features between subjects and, thus, minimized inter-subject spectral differences. Frequency scaling of DTFs reduced spectral differences by a median value of 15.5{\%} across all pairs of subjects and by more than half in 9.5{\%} of subject pairs. Optimal scale factors showed a median value of 1.061 and a maximum of 1.38. The optimal scale factor between any pair of subjects correlated highly with the ratios of subjects' maximum interaural delays, sizes of their external ears, and widths of their heads.},

abstract = {Experimental data are available for the Head‚Äêrelated impulse response (HRIR) for several azimuth and elevation angles, and for several subjects. The measured HRIR depends on several factors such as reflections from body parts (torso, shoulder, and knees), head diffraction, and reflection/diffraction effects due to the external ear (pinna). Due to the combined influence of these factors on the HRIR, it is difficult to isolate features thought to be perceptually important (such as the frequencies of pinna spectral notches) using standard signal‚Äêprocessing techniques. Signal‚Äêprocessing methods to extract the frequencies of the pinna spectral notches from the HRIR are presented. The techniques are applied to extracting the frequencies of the pinna spectral notches from the publicly available HRIR databases. A brief discussion relating the notch frequencies to the physical dimensions and the shape of the pinna is given. [The support of NSF Award ITR‚Äê0086075 is gratefully acknowledged.]},

abstract = {A recent development in human‚Äìcomputer interfaces is the virtual acoustic display, a device that synthesizes three‚Äêdimensional, spatial auditory information over headphones using digital filters constructed from head‚Äêrelated transfer functions (HRTFs). The utility of such a display depends on the accuracy with which listeners can localize virtual sound sources. A previous study [F. L. Wightman and D. J. Kistler, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 85, 868‚Äì878 (1989)] observed accurate localization by listeners for free‚Äêfield sources and for virtual sources generated from the subjects' own HRTFs.

HRTFs exhibit significant variation from person to person due to differences between their pinnae, and their body sizes. We propose and preliminarily implement a simple HRTF customization based on the use of a published database of HRTFs (Algazi et al., 2001) that also contains geometrical measurements of subject pinnae. We measure some of these features via simple image processing, and select the HRTF that has features most closely corresponding to the individual's features. This selection procedure is implemented along with the virtual auditory system described in (Zotkin et al., 2002), and listener tests conducted comparing the customized HRTF and a fixed HRTF. Despite the simplicity of the method, tests reveal average improvement in localization accuracy of about 25 percent, though performance improvement varies with source location and individuals.},

abstract = { Individualised head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) have been shown to accurately simulate forward and backward directional sounds. This study explores directional simulation for non-individualised HRTFs by determining orthogonal HRTFs for listeners to choose between. Using spectral features previously shown to aid forward‚Äìbackward differentiation, 196 non-individualised HRTFs were clustered into six orthogonal groups and the centre HRTF of each group was selected as representative. An experiment with 15 listeners was conducted to evaluate the benefits of choosing between six centre-front and six centre-back directional sounds rather than the single front/back sounds produced by MIT-KEMAR HRTFs. Sound localisation error was significantly reduced by 22{\%} and 65{\%} of listeners reduced their front‚Äìback confusion rates. The significant reduction was maintained when the number of HRTFs was reduced from six to five. This represents a preliminary success in bridging the gap between individual and non-individual HRTFs for applications such as spatial surround sound systems. Statement of Relevance:Due to different pinna shapes, directional sound stimuli generated by non-individualised HRTFs suffer from serious front‚Äìback confusion. The reported work demonstrates a way to reduce front‚Äìback confusion for centre-back sounds generated from non-individualised HRTFs. },

abstract = {The effectiveness of a three-dimensional (3D) auditory display in conveying directional information was investigated in a flight simulation experiment. While flying a simulated fighter aircraft, participants followed a target aircraft that suddenly disappeared and reemerged at an unknown position. The task was to locate and trail the target as quickly as possible. In all conditions the participants viewed a computer-generated outside image, on which they could spot the target only when it was at short range, and a three-dimensional (3D) tactical display indicating the target position at all distances within a limited field of view. Additional displays were a bird's-eye-view radar display, which also indicated whether the target was above or below the own plane, and a 3D auditory display, which generated a warning sound from the relative direction of the target. The auditory display used individualized head-related transfer functions to create a virtual sound source and a head-tracking device to decouple the position of the source from head movements. Results show that the radar and auditory displays caused about the same significant reduction in search time in comparison with the tactical display only. A further reduction was found when the two additional displays were presented simultaneously.},

In spatial sound simulations, partial models, such as the spherical head model, can also generate simple and effective approximate localization cues. We consider the composition of an approximate HRTF from the responses of structural components by making use of detailed measurements of isolated pinnae and of a pinna-less head and torso. We determine that such a composition is sensitive to additional geometric parameters that can be obtained from anthropometry. We show that, with such parameters, simple composition rules can produce a good correspondence between measured and composite HRTFs},

"¬†Many techniques have been recently proposed for HRTF personalization [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] based on a selected set of anthropometric features." (for above)


Conclusion:
"We proposed a method for HRTF phase frequency response synthesis using anthropometric features and sparse representation. The phase frequency response is modeled as average ITD, function of the direction and elevation, scaled accordingly to the subject's personal ITD, which depends on the subject's anthropometric features. The anthropometric features of a given subject are presented as a sparse linear combination of the anthropometric features of the subjects in the dataset, and then the same relation is used to estimate the ITD scaling factor and thereby synthesize a personalized set of HRTF phases. The root mean square error conÔ¨Årms the effectiveness of the sparse representation based approach. Our method shows lower error than all other evaluated techniques and obtains results closest to the best classiÔ¨Åer (i.e. the nearest ITD scaling factor in the training set). Future work includes combining the magnitude and phase estimation methods, determining a perceptually motivated distance measure, and validating the synthesized HRTFs in a perceptual experiment."},

The impact of the different components can be extracted from the HRIR, if the reflections caused by shoulders, torso, and pinna are¬†separated." page 8


"Spectral cues occurring at middle and low frequency bands ({\{}{\{}{\}}

"¬†Blauert [Bla70] found out, that energy in speciÔ¨Åc frequency bands (280-560 Hz, 2.9-5.8 kHz) result in frontal perception whereas others (720-1800 Hz, 10.3-14.9 kHz) tend to be perceived as coming more from the back. " - page 8


"¬†Tan and Gan [Tan98] continued Myers work and implemented a set of parallel Ô¨Ålters based on Ô¨Åve frequency regions (f1: 225-680 Hz, f2: 680-2000 Hz, f3: 2-6.3 kHz, f4: 6.3-10.9 kHz, f5: 10.9-22 kHz). For frontal localization f1, f3 and f5 were ampliÔ¨Åed whereas f2 and f4 were attenuated for backward perception. However, they did not describe the full experiment and statistical analysis." - useful for film/vg stuff (page 8)


"Kulkarni and Colburn mentioned that a smoothing of the HRTFs by reducing the Fourier coeÔ¨Écients in the reconstruction of the magnitude spectrum did not signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äect localizationperformance, evenwhenthecoeÔ¨Écientswerereducedfrom256to16[KC98]. Furthermore, in a test focusing on azimuth location, all subjects reported complete externalization of the sound stimuli." - page 9, not entirely sure I understand it but it seems important.¬†


Minimum Phase definition from Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\_}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}phase:¬†In¬†control theory¬†and¬†signal processing, a¬†linear, time-invariant¬†system is said to be¬†minimum-phase¬†if the system and its¬†inverse¬†are¬†causal¬†and¬†stable.


"HRTFs are usually decomposed into a directional and a non-directional part, which are called Directional transfer function (DTF) and Common transfer function (CTF) or Average transfer function (ATF) [LB02], respectively." - page 10


So an HRTF can be decomposed into directional and non-directional by first calculating the CTF, then subtracting that from the HRTF


"we can be gradually accustomed over time to HRTFs others than our ones [Bla83]." - page 10


"A large number of methods to model HRTFs have been proposed. These can be categorized in signal models, anthropometric models and orthogonal basis function expansions" - page 12 then goes on to explain the models


"Wenzel et al. [Wen88] found a relationship between a listeners accuracy in vertical localization and the characteristics of a listeners external ears" - page 14 this could help if I go down the route of adapting the hrtfs based on localization errors


"Some studies ([BD98], [XLZ07]) investigated the importance of various anatomical structures in relation to sound localization." - page 14 these studies could help me work out what I need to focus on


On numerical models: "Currently, there are still issues to measure the pinna accurately. Even small deviations in measurement can cause large errors in modelling. However, if there is a precise measurement, this approach can have good results [Sot99]. " - page 14 - so this is a reason why a numerical model for hrtf personalization won't work based on my requirement that the system be based on simple input. A process that breaks should a user measure SLIGHTLY incorrectly would be bad in that case


Successfully decomposed hrtfs into three features: "Raykar et al. [RDD03] decomposed the HRTF into diÔ¨Äerent components and extracted features that could be perceptually relevant for sound source localization. By relating these features to the anthropometry, it could be possible to model HRTFs for any subject and source position. Linear prediction (LP) analysis was applied to extract the poles of the HRIR. For any given azimuth, a 2D image (HRIR or HRTF) of all elevations was calculated from the CIPIC database. Three distinct features could be marked by visual inspection: ITD with head diÔ¨Äraction with pinna eÔ¨Äects, torso reÔ¨Çections and knee reÔ¨Çections since the subject were measured seated. In order to isolate various spectral peaks and notches, poles were extracted by Linear Prediction Analysis (LP). These poles correspond to the resonances of the pinna. The results were in agreement of the thesis by Shaw [Sha97] describing six modes of resonance" - page 15


to read: "Martens [Mar87] presented a model that is based on PCA and minimum-phase reconstruction." - page 16


"Kistler and Wightman [KW92] analyzed HRTFs of 10 subjects using PCA and showed that more than 90{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of HRTF variance can be approximated with only 5 of 150 basis spectral functions." - page 16 - familiarise self with rest of this passage because it seems key


"The Ô¨Årst principal component therefore contains most of the interaural intensity information necessary for lateral discrimination. Front-back and up-down performance dramatically decreased when using less than Ô¨Åve PCs." - page 16 - useful to know


"A high correlation between the two diÔ¨Äerent sets of basis vectors was found (PC1: 96{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}, PC2: 88{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}, PC3: 70{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}). This reveals that PCA is relatively robust to diÔ¨Äerent measurement techniques" - page 17 - meaning that applying PCA to my own hrtfs should result in similar results to these researchers?¬†


"Prior to experiment, an HRTF customization procedure has been applied, because non-individualized HRTF sets were used." - READ THIS PAPER, Qian and Eddins


"For seven of nine subjects there was no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerence between using measured or customized HRIRs. Contrary, localization performance for all probands increased when using individual instead of KEMAR HRIRs." - page 18 - customized hrtfs can be as good as measured ones, individual hrtfs are better than KEMAR


"To use the powerful mechanism of component decomposition, several individualization techniques based on PCA were established. By subjective adjustment of the component weights, localization performance could be signiÔ¨Åcantly increased. In Section 4, fundamental studies are presented." - page23 - If manual, subjective, adjustment of the component weights can yield improved results, then¬†

Exp 1 involved PCA of HRTF measurements from 10 adult listeners at 265 source positions. Exp 2 assessed the perceptual validity of the PCA model. HRTFs were used to synthesize stimuli that, when presented over headphones, simulated real free-field sources. Ss' judgments of the apparent directions of synthesized and real free-field sources were compared as a way of determining the perceptual validity of the PCA model.

abstract = {Individual head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) can be used to gen- erate virtual sound sources over headphones. According to the model of HRTF individualization using Principal Components (PCs), a Principal Component Weight (PCW) set is sought that when multiplied with a PC basis results in an HRTF set that yields good localization for a number of given directions of sound incidence. Although this is a promising model, the extent to which listeners can perform the individualization by hearing is debatable. The process requires adjustment for each location and PC of interest. In this work, the feasibility of a local and global method is numerically evaluated by estimating the accuracy with which a given basis component can model HRTFs regarding different kinds of input data. The number of required adjustments for a given direction set is then reduced by decomposing the PCW of individual users upon a Spherical Harmonics Basis. Optimal spherical model parameters are sought, depending on the order and reconstruction accuracy. In a listening test, subjects were asked to identify changes in localization when weights of individual directions are automatically modified. This allows a deeper inside into the usability of each technique.},

abstract = {Prior research has investigated development of virtual auditory displays (VADs) using low-dimensional models of head related transfer functions (HRTFs) as a function of a finite number of principal components (PCs) and associated weights (PCWs). This paper investigates the effect of PCWs on horizontal plane HRTFs derived from a database of HRIRs through analytical optimization experiments. The experiments investigate whether average HRTFs can be tuned to match individual HRTFs. Results provide insight on the effect of tuning PCWs on spectral features of the HRTF. A reduced order modeling technique is used to compactly represent each HRTF. Subject testing results are provided, showing that a human can conduct the tuning procedure and reduce localization errors. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Since these are relatively tedious to acquire, they may not be acceptable for some applications. A number of studies have sought to perform simple customization of the HRTF. We propose and test a strategy for HRTF personalization, based on matching certain anthropometric ear parameters with the HRTF database, and the incorporation of a low-frequency "head-and-torso" model. We present preliminary tests aimed at evaluation of this customization. Results show that the approach improves both the accuracy of the localization and subjective perception of the virtual auditory scene.},

The basis functions cover the inter-individual and inter-elevation variations in median HRIRs. There are elevation-dependent tendencies in the weights of basis functions. We propose a HRIR customization method via tuning of the weights of 3 dominant basis functions corresponding to the 3 largest standard deviations at each elevation.

abstract = {The analysis and modeling of the response of parts of the body provides valuable insight into many features of the head-related transfer function (HRTF). In spatial sound simulations, partial models, such as the spherical head model, can also generate simple and effective approximate localization cues. We consider the composition of an approximate HRTF from the responses of structural components by making use of detailed measurements of isolated pinnae and of a pinna-less head and torso. We determine that such a composition is sensitive to additional geometric parameters that can be obtained from anthropometry. We show that, with such parameters, simple composition rules can produce a good correspondence between measured and composite HRTFs},

abstract = {Recent research indicates that is necessary to provide ways of adapting HRTFs to individuals since generalized HRTF models result in perceptual problems and individualized HRTFs are costly to measure. The project investigates in HRTF individualization using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the related liter-ature on HRTFs is discussed. The process of HRTF individualization using PCA is formalized and a Least Squares feasibility analysis is presented. To this end, existing HRTF databases are analyzed, with a focus on the impact of estimation methodology and database configuration on the coherence of the produced Prin-cipal Components (PCs) and Principal Component Weights (PCWs). Some initial throughs on the development of a system for HRTF individualization are presented together with a user interface that allows the adjustment of the PCWs using the different methods discussed for a number of existing HRTF databases.},

Cone of Confusion is caused by ITD
Torus of Confusion is caused by ILD


So ILD and ITD are the main components of the duplex theory of sound localization, but duplex theroy fails to account for front/back confusion and elevation¬†


"The impact of the presence of the body, head and outer eat is to cause peaks and notches in the HRTF frequency response. These spectral cues are mostly contained in the first 0.7ms of the HRIR [BD98]. The impact of the different components can be extracted from the HRIR, if the reflections caused by shoulders, torso, and pinna are¬†separated." page 8

"¬†Tan and Gan [Tan98] continued Myers work and implemented a set of parallel Ô¨Ålters based on Ô¨Åve frequency regions (f1: 225-680 Hz, f2: 680-2000 Hz, f3: 2-6.3 kHz, f4: 6.3-10.9 kHz, f5: 10.9-22 kHz). For frontal localization f1, f3 and f5 were ampliÔ¨Åed whereas f2 and f4 were attenuated for backward perception. However, they did not describe the full experiment and statistical analysis." - useful for film/vg stuff (page 8)


"Kulkarni and Colburn mentioned that a smoothing of the HRTFs by reducing the Fourier coeÔ¨Écients in the reconstruction of the magnitude spectrum did not signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äect localizationperformance, evenwhenthecoeÔ¨Écientswerereducedfrom256to16[KC98]. Furthermore, in a test focusing on azimuth location, all subjects reported complete externalization of the sound stimuli." - page 9, not entirely sure I understand it but it seems important.¬†

"HRTFs are usually decomposed into a directional and a non-directional part, which are called Directional transfer function (DTF) and Common transfer function (CTF) or Average transfer function (ATF) [LB02], respectively." - page 10


So an HRTF can be decomposed into directional and non-directional by first calculating the CTF, then subtracting that from the HRTF


"we can be gradually accustomed over time to HRTFs others than our ones [Bla83]." - page 10


"A large number of methods to model HRTFs have been proposed. These can be categorized in signal models, anthropometric models and orthogonal basis function expansions" - page 12 then goes on to explain the models


"Wenzel et al. [Wen88] found a relationship between a listeners accuracy in vertical localization and the characteristics of a listeners external ears" - page 14 this could help if I go down the route of adapting the hrtfs based on localization errors


"Some studies ([BD98], [XLZ07]) investigated the importance of various anatomical structures in relation to sound localization." - page 14 these studies could help me work out what I need to focus on


On numerical models: "Currently, there are still issues to measure the pinna accurately. Even small deviations in measurement can cause large errors in modelling. However, if there is a precise measurement, this approach can have good results [Sot99]. " - page 14 - so this is a reason why a numerical model for hrtf personalization won't work based on my requirement that the system be based on simple input. A process that breaks should a user measure SLIGHTLY incorrectly would be bad in that case


Successfully decomposed hrtfs into three features: "Raykar et al. [RDD03] decomposed the HRTF into diÔ¨Äerent components and extracted features that could be perceptually relevant for sound source localization. By relating these features to the anthropometry, it could be possible to model HRTFs for any subject and source position. Linear prediction (LP) analysis was applied to extract the poles of the HRIR. For any given azimuth, a 2D image (HRIR or HRTF) of all elevations was calculated from the CIPIC database. Three distinct features could be marked by visual inspection: ITD with head diÔ¨Äraction with pinna eÔ¨Äects, torso reÔ¨Çections and knee reÔ¨Çections since the subject were measured seated. In order to isolate various spectral peaks and notches, poles were extracted by Linear Prediction Analysis (LP). These poles correspond to the resonances of the pinna. The results were in agreement of the thesis by Shaw [Sha97] describing six modes of resonance" - page 15

"Kistler and Wightman [KW92] analyzed HRTFs of 10 subjects using PCA and showed that more than 90{\{}{\%}{\}} of HRTF variance can be approximated with only 5 of 150 basis spectral functions." - page 16 - familiarise self with rest of this passage because it seems key


"The Ô¨Årst principal component therefore contains most of the interaural intensity information necessary for lateral discrimination. Front-back and up-down performance dramatically decreased when using less than Ô¨Åve PCs." - page 16 - useful to know


"A high correlation between the two diÔ¨Äerent sets of basis vectors was found (PC1: 96{\{}{\%}{\}}, PC2: 88{\{}{\%}{\}}, PC3: 70{\{}{\%}{\}}). This reveals that PCA is relatively robust to diÔ¨Äerent measurement techniques" - page 17 - meaning that applying PCA to my own hrtfs should result in similar results to these researchers?¬†


"Prior to experiment, an HRTF customization procedure has been applied, because non-individualized HRTF sets were used." - READ THIS PAPER, Qian and Eddins


"For seven of nine subjects there was no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerence between using measured or customized HRIRs. Contrary, localization performance for all probands increased when using individual instead of KEMAR HRIRs." - page 18 - customized hrtfs can be as good as measured ones, individual hrtfs are better than KEMAR


"To use the powerful mechanism of component decomposition, several individualization techniques based on PCA were established. By subjective adjustment of the component weights, localization performance could be signiÔ¨Åcantly increased. In Section 4, fundamental studies are presented." - page23 - If manual, subjective, adjustment of the component weights can yield improved results, then¬†

Minimum Phase definition from Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum{\{}{\_}{\}}phase:¬†In¬†control theory¬†and¬†signal processing, a¬†linear, time-invariant¬†system is said to be¬†minimum-phase¬†if the system and its¬†inverse¬†are¬†causal¬†and¬†stable.


"HRTFs are usually decomposed into a directional and a non-directional part, which are called Directional transfer function (DTF) and Common transfer function (CTF) or Average transfer function (ATF) [LB02], respectively." - page 10


So an HRTF can be decomposed into directional and non-directional by first calculating the CTF, then subtracting that from the HRTF


"we can be gradually accustomed over time to HRTFs others than our ones [Bla83]." - page 10


"A large number of methods to model HRTFs have been proposed. These can be categorized in signal models, anthropometric models and orthogonal basis function expansions" - page 12 then goes on to explain the models


"Wenzel et al. [Wen88] found a relationship between a listeners accuracy in vertical localization and the characteristics of a listeners external ears" - page 14 this could help if I go down the route of adapting the hrtfs based on localization errors


"Some studies ([BD98], [XLZ07]) investigated the importance of various anatomical structures in relation to sound localization." - page 14 these studies could help me work out what I need to focus on


On numerical models: "Currently, there are still issues to measure the pinna accurately. Even small deviations in measurement can cause large errors in modelling. However, if there is a precise measurement, this approach can have good results [Sot99]. " - page 14 - so this is a reason why a numerical model for hrtf personalization won't work based on my requirement that the system be based on simple input. A process that breaks should a user measure SLIGHTLY incorrectly would be bad in that case


Successfully decomposed hrtfs into three features: "Raykar et al. [RDD03] decomposed the HRTF into diÔ¨Äerent components and extracted features that could be perceptually relevant for sound source localization. By relating these features to the anthropometry, it could be possible to model HRTFs for any subject and source position. Linear prediction (LP) analysis was applied to extract the poles of the HRIR. For any given azimuth, a 2D image (HRIR or HRTF) of all elevations was calculated from the CIPIC database. Three distinct features could be marked by visual inspection: ITD with head diÔ¨Äraction with pinna eÔ¨Äects, torso reÔ¨Çections and knee reÔ¨Çections since the subject were measured seated. In order to isolate various spectral peaks and notches, poles were extracted by Linear Prediction Analysis (LP). These poles correspond to the resonances of the pinna. The results were in agreement of the thesis by Shaw [Sha97] describing six modes of resonance" - page 15


to read: "Martens [Mar87] presented a model that is based on PCA and minimum-phase reconstruction." - page 16


"Kistler and Wightman [KW92] analyzed HRTFs of 10 subjects using PCA and showed that more than 90{\{}{\%}{\}} of HRTF variance can be approximated with only 5 of 150 basis spectral functions." - page 16 - familiarise self with rest of this passage because it seems key


"The Ô¨Årst principal component therefore contains most of the interaural intensity information necessary for lateral discrimination. Front-back and up-down performance dramatically decreased when using less than Ô¨Åve PCs." - page 16 - useful to know


"A high correlation between the two diÔ¨Äerent sets of basis vectors was found (PC1: 96{\{}{\%}{\}}, PC2: 88{\{}{\%}{\}}, PC3: 70{\{}{\%}{\}}). This reveals that PCA is relatively robust to diÔ¨Äerent measurement techniques" - page 17 - meaning that applying PCA to my own hrtfs should result in similar results to these researchers?¬†


"Prior to experiment, an HRTF customization procedure has been applied, because non-individualized HRTF sets were used." - READ THIS PAPER, Qian and Eddins


"For seven of nine subjects there was no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerence between using measured or customized HRIRs. Contrary, localization performance for all probands increased when using individual instead of KEMAR HRIRs." - page 18 - customized hrtfs can be as good as measured ones, individual hrtfs are better than KEMAR


"To use the powerful mechanism of component decomposition, several individualization techniques based on PCA were established. By subjective adjustment of the component weights, localization performance could be signiÔ¨Åcantly increased. In Section 4, fundamental studies are presented." - page23 - If manual, subjective, adjustment of the component weights can yield improved results, then¬†
