abstract = {Individual head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) can be used to gen- erate virtual sound sources over headphones. According to the model of HRTF individualization using Principal Components (PCs), a Principal Component Weight (PCW) set is sought that when multiplied with a PC basis results in an HRTF set that yields good localization for a number of given directions of sound incidence. Although this is a promising model, the extent to which listeners can perform the individualization by hearing is debatable. The process requires adjustment for each location and PC of interest. In this work, the feasibility of a local and global method is numerically evaluated by estimating the accuracy with which a given basis component can model HRTFs regarding different kinds of input data. The number of required adjustments for a given direction set is then reduced by decomposing the PCW of individual users upon a Spherical Harmonics Basis. Optimal spherical model parameters are sought, depending on the order and reconstruction accuracy. In a listening test, subjects were asked to identify changes in localization when weights of individual directions are automatically modified. This allows a deeper inside into the usability of each technique.},

abstract = {Individualized head related transfer functions (HRTFs) are needed for accurate rendering of spatial audio, which is important in many applications. Since these are relatively tedious to acquire, they may not be acceptable for some applications. A number of studies have sought to perform simple customization of the HRTF. We propose and test a strategy for HRTF personalization, based on matching certain anthropometric ear parameters with the HRTF database, and incorporation of a low-frequency "head-and-torso" model. We present preliminary tests aimed at evaluation of this customization. Results show that the approach improves both the accuracy of the localization and subjective perception of the virtual auditory scene.

@article{Hugeng2010,
abstract = {An important problem to be solved in modeling head-related impulse responses (HRIRs) is how to individualize HRIRs so that they are suitable for a listener. We modeled the entire magnitude head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), in frequency domain, for sound sources on horizontal plane of 37 subjects using principal components analysis (PCA). The individual magnitude HRTFs could be modeled adequately well by a linear combination of only ten orthonormal basis functions. The goal of this research was to establish multiple linear regression (MLR) between weights of basis functions obtained from PCA and fewer anthropometric measurements in order to individualize a given listener's HRTFs with his or her own anthropomety. We proposed here an improved individualization method based on MLR of weights of basis functions by utilizing 8 chosen out of 27 anthropometric measurements. Our objective experiments' results show a superior performance than that of our previous work on individualizing minimum phase HRIRs and also better than similar research. The proposed individualization method shows that the individualized magnitude HRTFs could approximated well the the original ones with small error. Moving sound employing the reconstructed HRIRs could be perceived as if it was moving around the horizontal plane.},

abstract = { Individualised head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) have been shown to accurately simulate forward and backward directional sounds. This study explores directional simulation for non-individualised HRTFs by determining orthogonal HRTFs for listeners to choose between. Using spectral features previously shown to aid forward–backward differentiation, 196 non-individualised HRTFs were clustered into six orthogonal groups and the centre HRTF of each group was selected as representative. An experiment with 15 listeners was conducted to evaluate the benefits of choosing between six centre-front and six centre-back directional sounds rather than the single front/back sounds produced by MIT-KEMAR HRTFs. Sound localisation error was significantly reduced by 22{\%} and 65{\%} of listeners reduced their front–back confusion rates. The significant reduction was maintained when the number of HRTFs was reduced from six to five. This represents a preliminary success in bridging the gap between individual and non-individual HRTFs for applications such as spatial surround sound systems. Statement of Relevance:Due to different pinna shapes, directional sound stimuli generated by non-individualised HRTFs suffer from serious front–back confusion. The reported work demonstrates a way to reduce front–back confusion for centre-back sounds generated from non-individualised HRTFs. },

@phdthesis{Romigh2012a,
abstract = {This dissertation develops and evaluates a novel way of modeling and estimating individ- ualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) from a priori information and a limited number of acoustic measurements. Head-related transfer functions represent and describe the acoustic transformations caused by interactions of sound with a listener's head, shoulders, and outer ears which give a sound its directional characteristics. Once this transformation is measured, it can be combined with any non-directional sound to give a listener the per- ceptual illusion that the sound originated from a designated location in space. The ability to manipulate these spatial auditory cues has many applications for both immersive and informational spatial auditory displays (SADs). Unfortunately, high delity SADs require the use of individualized head-related transfer functions that are measured for the speci c end user of the spatial auditory display. These measurements are typically impractical for widespread commercialization, in large part because traditional HRTF measurement tech- niques require several hundred spatial locations to be measured around a listener, a procedure which requires expensive and complicated equipment, and which can take upwards of two hours. This dissertation introduces a novel way to represent a spatially continuous HRTF with a relatively small number of parameters via a spherical harmonic decomposition. This rep- resentation is shown to be perceptually equivalent to a full HRTF in terms of the resulting localization accuracy, while providing a convenient form for making HRTF comparisons across individuals and spatial locations. With this new framework it is shown that HRTFs from a large group of individuals can be modeled e ectively with a multivariate normal dis- tribution, and that this underlying distribution can be used to provide a priori information for individualized HRTF estimation allowing accurate estimates from as few as 12 spatially distributed locations. The new representation is also shown to be particularly well suited for the separation of individual and non-individual components of the HRTF. Analysis of the underlying distribu- tions characterizing the HRTF, as well as perceptual evidence, indicates that only the spatial variation in an HRTF which corresponds to the vertical and front-back dimensions of a sound source location need to be individualized. This nding forms the basis of what is referred to as the sectoral HRTF model. The sectoral HRTF model is shown to be valid in terms of localization accuracy and provides a way to capture the individual components in an HRTF with only nine parameters at a single frequency. The relationship between these parameters and the spatial variance along the vertical and front-back dimensions is also exploited to allow relatively accurate HRTF estimation from acoustic measurements that are limited to a single plane. Together, these developments provide signi cant advancements in the ease with which individualized HRTFs are collected, as well as a wealth of new information relvent to ecient HRTF modeling.},

abstract = {Logic's basic elements are unfolded in this book. The relation of and the transition from Logic to Logic Programming are analysed. With the use and the development of computers in the beginning of the 1950's, it soon became clear that computers could be used, not only for arithmetical computation, but also for symbolic computation. Hence, the first arithmetical computation programs, and the first programs created to answer elementary questions and prove simple theorems, were written simultaneously. The basic steps towards a general method based on Logic, were accomplished in 1965 by Robinson and later by Kowalski and Colmerauer who made use of Logic directly as a Logic Programming language. Each chapter includes solved as well as unsolved exercises provided to help the reader assimilate the corresponding topics. The solved exercises demonstrate how to work methodically, whereas the unsolved exercises aim to stimulate the reader's personal initiative. The contents of the book are self-contained; only an elementary knowledge of analysis is required. Thus, it can be used by students in every academic year, as simply reading material, or in the context of a course. It can also be used by those who utilize Logic Programming without having any particular theoretical background knowledge of Logic, or by those simply interested in Logic and its applications in Logic Programming.},

abstract = {Nowadays, multimodal human-like sensing, e.g. vision, haptics and audition seeks to improve interaction between an operator (human) and a teleoperator (robot) in human centered robotic systems. Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) based sound rendering techniques, which seek to create a realistic virtual auditory space for listeners, have become a prominent concept in human robot interaction. Applications that demand high quality 3D sound synthesis are usually based on measured HRTFs of listeners. Recently, researchers propose to construct a set of personalized HRTFs using multiple linear regression models between anthropometric data and measured HRTFs, which implies the existence of a training HRTF dataset together with the corresponding anthropometric data. This paper focuses on the measurement of Head-Related transfer Functions (HRTFs) and the corresponding anthropometric data of a listener. Several state-of-the-art techniques of measuring the HRTFs are described. For measuring the anthropometric data, we develop a low budget approach, which enables us to measure the anthropometry of a person within short time at a high accuracy, whereas the hardware costs for the scanning system are significantly reduced.},

abstract = {Pole-zero approximations of human free-field-to-eardrum transfer functions-i.e., head-related transfer functions (HRTFs)-can be used to synthesize binaural acoustic fields over headphones with fewer parameters, and therefore, lower computational complexity than is typically achieved by all-zero approximations. While standard pole-zero designs minimize the squared difference between the desired and designed frequency responses, the synthesis of binaural acoustic fields is more likely to be sensitive to relative, rather than absolute, differences in the HRTF approximations. The paper proposes a new design algorithm that minimizes an error criterion based on complex logarithms. As a result, both log-magnitude and phase errors are minimized. Slight modifications to the proposed algorithm result in one for which the phase error can be ignored. A comparison of this modified algorithm to others that have been developed to minimize the log-magnitude error shows implementation advantages without sacrificing performance.

abstract = {Despite the prominence of artificial reverberation in music production, there are few studies that explore the conventional usage and the resulting perception in the context of a mixing studio. Research into the use of artificial reverberation is difficult because of the lack of standardized parameters, inconsistent interfaces, and a diverse group of algorithms. In multistimuli listening tests, trained engineers were asked to rate 80 mixes that were generated from 10 professional-grade music recordings. Annotated subjective comments were also analyzed to determine the importance of reverberation in the perception of mixes, as well as classifying mixes as having too much or too little overall reverberation. The results support the notion that a universally preferred amount of reverberation is unlikely to exist, but the upper and lower bounds can be identified. The importance of careful parameter adjustment is evident from the limited range of acceptable feature values with regard to the perceived amount of reverberation relative to the just-noticeable differences in both reverberation loudness and early decay time. This study confirms previous findings that a perceived excess of reverberation typically has a detrimental effect on subjective preference. The ability to predict the desired amount of reverberation with a reasonable degree of accuracy has applications in automatic mixing and intelligent audio effects.},

abstract = {All software construction involves essential tasks, the fashioning of the complex conceptual structures that compose the abstract software entity, and accidental tasks, the representation of these abstract entities in programming languages and the mapping of these onto machine languages within space and speed constraints. Most of the big past gains in software productivity have come from removing artificial barriers that have made the accidental tasks inordinately hard, such as severe hardware constraints, awkward programming languages, lack of machine time. How much of what software engineers now do is still devoted to the accidental, as opposed to the essential? Unless it is more than 9/10 of all effort, shrinking all the accidental activities to zero time will not give an order of magnitude improvement. Therefore it appears that the time has come to address the essential parts of the software task, those concerned with fashioning abstract conceptual structures of great complexity. I suggest: • Exploiting the mass market to avoid constructing what can be bought. • Using rapid prototyping as part of a planned iteration in establishing software requirements. • Growing software organically, adding more and more function to systems as they are run, used, and tested. • Identifying and developing the great conceptual designers of the rising generation.

The directional components of such transfer functions are referred here to as directional transfer functions (DTFs). The DTFs of 45 subjects varied systematically among subjects in regard to the frequencies of spectral features such as peaks and notches. Inter-subject spectral differences in DTFs were quantified between 3.7 and 12.9 kHz for sound-source directions throughout the coordinate sphere. For each pair of subjects, an optimal frequency scale factor aligned spectral features between subjects and, thus, minimized inter-subject spectral differences. Frequency scaling of DTFs reduced spectral differences by a median value of 15.5{\%} across all pairs of subjects and by more than half in 9.5{\%} of subject pairs. Optimal scale factors showed a median value of 1.061 and a maximum of 1.38. The optimal scale factor between any pair of subjects correlated highly with the ratios of subjects' maximum interaural delays, sizes of their external ears, and widths of their heads.},

These transformations, which primarily result from the interaction of the acoustic wave with the complex geometry of the head and pinna, are known to be the principal determinants of source location. It is especially known that the interaural time differences (ITDs) are encoded by the phase spectra of the HRTFs at the two ears. In this study we explore a model of the HRTF which approximates the HRTF as a minimum phase function. The model is tested both theoretically and through psychophysical experiments. Results suggest that a minimum phase representation of the phase spectra, augmented by a position-dependent, frequency-independent ITD, is an adequate description of the HRTF phase. Both the scientific and the practical consequences of this result shall be discussed},

abstract = {We present a new anthropometry-based method to personalize head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) using manifold learning in both azimuth and elevation angles with a single nonlinear regression model. The core element of our approach is a domain-specific nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, denominated Isomap, over the intraconic component of HRTFs resulting from a spectral decomposition. HRTF intraconic components encode the most important cues for HRTF individualization, leaving out subject-independent cues. First, we modify the graph construction procedure of Isomap to integrate relevant prior knowledge of spatial audio into a single manifold for all subjects by exploiting the existing correlations among HRTFs across individuals, directions, and ears. Then, with the aim of preserving the multifactor nature of HRTFs (i.e. subject, direction and frequency), we train a single artificial neural network to predict low-dimensional HRTFs from anthropometric features. Finally, we reconstruct the HRTF from its estimated low-dimensional version using a neighborhood-based reconstruction approach. Our findings show that introducing prior knowledge in Isomap's manifold is a powerful way to capture the underlying factors of spatial hearing. Our experiments show, with p-values less than 0.05, that our approach outperforms using, either a PCA linear reduction, or the full HTRF, in its intermediate stages},

Conclusion:
"We proposed a method for HRTF phase frequency response synthesis using anthropometric features and sparse representation. The phase frequency response is modeled as average ITD, function of the direction and elevation, scaled accordingly to the subject's personal ITD, which depends on the subject's anthropometric features. The anthropometric features of a given subject are presented as a sparse linear combination of the anthropometric features of the subjects in the dataset, and then the same relation is used to estimate the ITD scaling factor and thereby synthesize a personalized set of HRTF phases. The root mean square error conﬁrms the effectiveness of the sparse representation based approach. Our method shows lower error than all other evaluated techniques and obtains results closest to the best classiﬁer (i.e. the nearest ITD scaling factor in the training set). Future work includes combining the magnitude and phase estimation methods, determining a perceptually motivated distance measure, and validating the synthesized HRTFs in a perceptual experiment."},

Albeit most of the time they only use generic Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs), the recent standardization of the HRTF format SOFA has paved the way to support individualized HRTFs broadly. We have developed and implemented MySofa: a web service that helps users to design a personal HRTF. In MySofa, based on anthropometric and user inputs, algo- rithms calculate and tune HRTFs. The result is displayed in the web browser and the user can listen to test render- ings to verify, whether the personalized HRTF matches his expectations. In order to foster the use of individualized HRTF, we also implemented a light weight C-library called libmysofa, which helps programmers to read SOFA files and lookup FIR filters.},

abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted on elicitation studies to examine the perceptual importance of localisation-specific and localisation-related attributes. It was found that the majority of attributes were localisation-related, including (in order of commonality) extent, locatedness, distribution, spaciousness and movement. The most common localisation-specific attribute was distance, with only 2.6{\%} of the attributes relating to the perceived lateral position. It is concluded that localisation accuracy experiments may enable experimenters to make predictions about a reasonable proportion of the attributes found, though further research is needed to develop suitable analysis techniques. In addition, more research is required to develop subjective and objective methods for judging perceived distance.},

abstract = {The analysis and modeling of the response of parts of the body provides valuable insight into many features of the head-related transfer function (HRTF). In spatial sound simulations, partial models, such as the spherical head model, can also generate simple and effective approximate localization cues. We consider the composition of an approximate HRTF from the responses of structural components by making use of detailed measurements of isolated pinnae and of a pinna-less head and torso. We determine that such a composition is sensitive to additional geometric parameters that can be obtained from anthropometry. We show that, with such parameters, simple composition rules can produce a good correspondence between measured and composite HRTFs},

Jaynes dispels the imaginary distinction between 'probability theory' and 'statistical inference', leaving a logical unity and simplicity, which provides greater technical power and flexibility in applications. This book goes beyond the conventional mathematics of probability theory, viewing the subject in a wider context. New results are discussed, along with applications of probability theory to a wide variety of problems in physics, mathematics, economics, chemistry and biology. It contains many exercises and problems, and is suitable for use as a textbook on graduate level courses involving data analysis. The material is aimed at readers who are already familiar with applied mathematics at an advanced undergraduate level or higher. The book will be of interest to scientists working in any area where inference from incomplete information is necessary.},

The project investigates in HRTF individualization using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the related liter-ature on HRTFs is discussed. The process of HRTF individualization using PCA is formalized and a Least Squares feasibility analysis is presented. To this end, existing HRTF databases are analyzed, with a focus on the impact of estimation methodology and database configuration on the coherence of the produced Prin-cipal Components (PCs) and Principal Component Weights (PCWs). Some initial throughs on the development of a system for HRTF individualization are presented together with a user interface that allows the adjustment of the PCWs using the different methods discussed for a number of existing HRTF databases.},

Cone of Confusion is caused by ITD
Torus of Confusion is caused by ILD


So ILD and ITD are the main components of the duplex theory of sound localization, but duplex theroy fails to account for front/back confusion and elevation 


"The impact of the presence of the body, head and outer eat is to cause peaks and notches in the HRTF frequency response. These spectral cues are mostly contained in the first 0.7ms of the HRIR [BD98]. The impact of the different components can be extracted from the HRIR, if the reflections caused by shoulders, torso, and pinna are separated." page 8

" Tan and Gan [Tan98] continued Myers work and implemented a set of parallel ﬁlters based on ﬁve frequency regions (f1: 225-680 Hz, f2: 680-2000 Hz, f3: 2-6.3 kHz, f4: 6.3-10.9 kHz, f5: 10.9-22 kHz). For frontal localization f1, f3 and f5 were ampliﬁed whereas f2 and f4 were attenuated for backward perception. However, they did not describe the full experiment and statistical analysis." - useful for film/vg stuff (page 8)


"Kulkarni and Colburn mentioned that a smoothing of the HRTFs by reducing the Fourier coeﬃcients in the reconstruction of the magnitude spectrum did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect localizationperformance, evenwhenthecoeﬃcientswerereducedfrom256to16[KC98]. Furthermore, in a test focusing on azimuth location, all subjects reported complete externalization of the sound stimuli." - page 9, not entirely sure I understand it but it seems important. 


Minimum Phase definition from Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum{\{}{\_}{\}}phase: In control theory and signal processing, a linear, time-invariant system is said to be minimum-phase if the system and its inverse are causal and stable.


"HRTFs are usually decomposed into a directional and a non-directional part, which are called Directional transfer function (DTF) and Common transfer function (CTF) or Average transfer function (ATF) [LB02], respectively." - page 10


So an HRTF can be decomposed into directional and non-directional by first calculating the CTF, then subtracting that from the HRTF


"we can be gradually accustomed over time to HRTFs others than our ones [Bla83]." - page 10


"A large number of methods to model HRTFs have been proposed. These can be categorized in signal models, anthropometric models and orthogonal basis function expansions" - page 12 then goes on to explain the models


"Wenzel et al. [Wen88] found a relationship between a listeners accuracy in vertical localization and the characteristics of a listeners external ears" - page 14 this could help if I go down the route of adapting the hrtfs based on localization errors


"Some studies ([BD98], [XLZ07]) investigated the importance of various anatomical structures in relation to sound localization." - page 14 these studies could help me work out what I need to focus on


On numerical models: "Currently, there are still issues to measure the pinna accurately. Even small deviations in measurement can cause large errors in modelling. However, if there is a precise measurement, this approach can have good results [Sot99]. " - page 14 - so this is a reason why a numerical model for hrtf personalization won't work based on my requirement that the system be based on simple input. A process that breaks should a user measure SLIGHTLY incorrectly would be bad in that case


Successfully decomposed hrtfs into three features: "Raykar et al. [RDD03] decomposed the HRTF into diﬀerent components and extracted features that could be perceptually relevant for sound source localization. By relating these features to the anthropometry, it could be possible to model HRTFs for any subject and source position. Linear prediction (LP) analysis was applied to extract the poles of the HRIR. For any given azimuth, a 2D image (HRIR or HRTF) of all elevations was calculated from the CIPIC database. Three distinct features could be marked by visual inspection: ITD with head diﬀraction with pinna eﬀects, torso reﬂections and knee reﬂections since the subject were measured seated. In order to isolate various spectral peaks and notches, poles were extracted by Linear Prediction Analysis (LP). These poles correspond to the resonances of the pinna. The results were in agreement of the thesis by Shaw [Sha97] describing six modes of resonance" - page 15


to read: "Martens [Mar87] presented a model that is based on PCA and minimum-phase reconstruction." - page 16


"Kistler and Wightman [KW92] analyzed HRTFs of 10 subjects using PCA and showed that more than 90{\{}{\%}{\}} of HRTF variance can be approximated with only 5 of 150 basis spectral functions." - page 16 - familiarise self with rest of this passage because it seems key


"The ﬁrst principal component therefore contains most of the interaural intensity information necessary for lateral discrimination. Front-back and up-down performance dramatically decreased when using less than ﬁve PCs." - page 16 - useful to know


"A high correlation between the two diﬀerent sets of basis vectors was found (PC1: 96{\{}{\%}{\}}, PC2: 88{\{}{\%}{\}}, PC3: 70{\{}{\%}{\}}). This reveals that PCA is relatively robust to diﬀerent measurement techniques" - page 17 - meaning that applying PCA to my own hrtfs should result in similar results to these researchers? 


"Prior to experiment, an HRTF customization procedure has been applied, because non-individualized HRTF sets were used." - READ THIS PAPER, Qian and Eddins


"For seven of nine subjects there was no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between using measured or customized HRIRs. Contrary, localization performance for all probands increased when using individual instead of KEMAR HRIRs." - page 18 - customized hrtfs can be as good as measured ones, individual hrtfs are better than KEMAR


"To use the powerful mechanism of component decomposition, several individualization techniques based on PCA were established. By subjective adjustment of the component weights, localization performance could be signiﬁcantly increased. In Section 4, fundamental studies are presented." - page23 - If manual, subjective, adjustment of the component weights can yield improved results, then

Minimum Phase definition from Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\_}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}phase: In control theory and signal processing, a linear, time-invariant system is said to be minimum-phase if the system and its inverse are causal and stable.


"HRTFs are usually decomposed into a directional and a non-directional part, which are called Directional transfer function (DTF) and Common transfer function (CTF) or Average transfer function (ATF) [LB02], respectively." - page 10


So an HRTF can be decomposed into directional and non-directional by first calculating the CTF, then subtracting that from the HRTF


"we can be gradually accustomed over time to HRTFs others than our ones [Bla83]." - page 10


"A large number of methods to model HRTFs have been proposed. These can be categorized in signal models, anthropometric models and orthogonal basis function expansions" - page 12 then goes on to explain the models


"Wenzel et al. [Wen88] found a relationship between a listeners accuracy in vertical localization and the characteristics of a listeners external ears" - page 14 this could help if I go down the route of adapting the hrtfs based on localization errors


"Some studies ([BD98], [XLZ07]) investigated the importance of various anatomical structures in relation to sound localization." - page 14 these studies could help me work out what I need to focus on


On numerical models: "Currently, there are still issues to measure the pinna accurately. Even small deviations in measurement can cause large errors in modelling. However, if there is a precise measurement, this approach can have good results [Sot99]. " - page 14 - so this is a reason why a numerical model for hrtf personalization won't work based on my requirement that the system be based on simple input. A process that breaks should a user measure SLIGHTLY incorrectly would be bad in that case


Successfully decomposed hrtfs into three features: "Raykar et al. [RDD03] decomposed the HRTF into diﬀerent components and extracted features that could be perceptually relevant for sound source localization. By relating these features to the anthropometry, it could be possible to model HRTFs for any subject and source position. Linear prediction (LP) analysis was applied to extract the poles of the HRIR. For any given azimuth, a 2D image (HRIR or HRTF) of all elevations was calculated from the CIPIC database. Three distinct features could be marked by visual inspection: ITD with head diﬀraction with pinna eﬀects, torso reﬂections and knee reﬂections since the subject were measured seated. In order to isolate various spectral peaks and notches, poles were extracted by Linear Prediction Analysis (LP). These poles correspond to the resonances of the pinna. The results were in agreement of the thesis by Shaw [Sha97] describing six modes of resonance" - page 15


to read: "Martens [Mar87] presented a model that is based on PCA and minimum-phase reconstruction." - page 16


"Kistler and Wightman [KW92] analyzed HRTFs of 10 subjects using PCA and showed that more than 90{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of HRTF variance can be approximated with only 5 of 150 basis spectral functions." - page 16 - familiarise self with rest of this passage because it seems key


"The ﬁrst principal component therefore contains most of the interaural intensity information necessary for lateral discrimination. Front-back and up-down performance dramatically decreased when using less than ﬁve PCs." - page 16 - useful to know


"A high correlation between the two diﬀerent sets of basis vectors was found (PC1: 96{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}, PC2: 88{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}, PC3: 70{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}). This reveals that PCA is relatively robust to diﬀerent measurement techniques" - page 17 - meaning that applying PCA to my own hrtfs should result in similar results to these researchers? 


"Prior to experiment, an HRTF customization procedure has been applied, because non-individualized HRTF sets were used." - READ THIS PAPER, Qian and Eddins


"For seven of nine subjects there was no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between using measured or customized HRIRs. Contrary, localization performance for all probands increased when using individual instead of KEMAR HRIRs." - page 18 - customized hrtfs can be as good as measured ones, individual hrtfs are better than KEMAR


"To use the powerful mechanism of component decomposition, several individualization techniques based on PCA were established. By subjective adjustment of the component weights, localization performance could be signiﬁcantly increased. In Section 4, fundamental studies are presented." - page23 - If manual, subjective, adjustment of the component weights can yield improved results, then

abstract = {This study deals with modeling and customization of head-related impulse responses (HRIRs) in the median plane based on general basis functions. To clarify whether the 12 principal components (PCs) obtained from principal components analysis of the median-plane HRIRs in the CIPIC HRTF database can be general basis functions to model arbitrary subject's median-plane HRIRs, which are not included in the process to obtain the basis functions, a series of subjective listening tests and an error analysis in the least-squares sense were carried out using the measured and modeled HRIRs. The results showed that the set of individual HRIRs, which were measured using different measurement conditions, techniques, and source positions from the CIPIC dataset, can be modeled with reasonable accuracy. All subjects reported accurate elevation perception in the median plane with the modeled HRIRs from the general basis functions. A novel HRIR customization method based on subjective tuning of the general basis functions was proposed. At each elevation, the only three weights of dominant basis functions corresponding to the three largest inter-subject variations were tuned by a subject and the weights of other basis functions were just mean values of all subjects in the CIPIC HRTF database. In the subjective listening test results, all subjects reported dramatically improved performances for the vertical perception and the front-back discrimination with the customized HRIRs than those with the non-individual HRIRs. {\textcopyright} S.

abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and pinna reflection patterns in the frontal hemispace. A pre-processed database of HRTFs allows extraction of up to three spectral notches from each response taken in the median sagittal plane. Ray-tracing analysis performed on the obtained notches' central frequencies is compared with a set of possible reflection surfaces directly recognizeable from the corresponding pinna picture. Results of such analysis are discussed in terms of the reflection coefficient sign, which is found to be most likely negative. Based on this finding, a model for real-time HRTF synthesis that allows to control separately the evolution of different acoustic phenomena such as head diffraction, ear resonances, and reflections is proposed through the design of distinct filter blocks. Parameters to be fed to the model are derived either from analysis or from specific anthropometric features of the subject. Finally, objective evaluations of reconstructed HRTFs in the chosen spatial range are performed through spectral distortion measurements.},

HRTFs exhibit significant variation from person to person due to differences between their pinnae, and their body sizes. We propose and preliminarily implement a simple HRTF customization based on the use of a published database of HRTFs (Algazi et al., 2001) that also contains geometrical measurements of subject pinnae. We measure some of these features via simple image processing, and select the HRTF that has features most closely corresponding to the individual's features. This selection procedure is implemented along with the virtual auditory system described in (Zotkin et al., 2002), and listener tests conducted comparing the customized HRTF and a fixed HRTF. Despite the simplicity of the method, tests reveal average improvement in localization accuracy of about 25 percent, though performance improvement varies with source location and individuals.},

abstract = {Many decades ago, Japanese professional Go-Moku players stated that Go-Moku (Five-in-a-row on a horizontally placed 15×15 board) is a won game for the player to move first. So far, this claim has never been substantiated by (a tree of) variations or by a computer program. Meanwhile many variants of Go-Moku with slightly different rules have been developed. This paper shows that for two common variants the game-theoretical value has been esta-blished. Moreover, the Go-Moku program Victoria is described. It uses two new search techniques, threat-space search and proof-number search. One of the results is that Victoria is bound to win against any (optimal) counterplay if it moves first. Further-more, it achieves good results as a defender against non-optimally playing opponents. In this contribu-tion we focus on threat-space search and its advan-tages compared to conventional search algorithms.},

abstract = {Applications of virtual auditory space need individual head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to simulate realistic scenarios. To avoid costly measurements a physical model of HRTFs has been developed considering the influence of a few acoustically relevant objects. Individual variations of HRTFs correspond to variations of geometrical parameters. In a first step, the head has been modeled by a rigid sphere and the pinna with cavum conchae by elliptical disks; the position of the ear reference point is one of the most important parameters. The correlation between calculated and measured HRTFs is significantly higher if the influence of shoulder/torso is modeled by an additional rigid sphere. In a second step, the shapes of head and shoulder/torso have been approximated with oblate respective prolate spheroids in order to get even better results. Sound field calculations have been performed using the boundary element method and analytical methods (solution of the wave equation, use of Huygens' integral formula). Computation time has been reduced by a factor of about 100 using and optimizing the source simulation technique for the diffraction problem of spheroids.},

One of the key factors for individual VAS is to obtain a set of individual head related transfer functions (HRTFs). A customization method based on back-propagation (BP) artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to obtain an individual HRTF without complex measurement. The inputs of the neural network are the anthropometric parameters chosen by correlation analysis and the outputs are the characteristic parameters of HRTFs together with the interaural time difference (ITD). Objective simulation experiments and subjective sound localization experiments are implemented to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experiments show that the estimated non-individual HRTF has small mean square error, and has similar perception effect to the corresponding one obtained from the database. Furthermore, the localization accuracy of personalized HRTF is increased compared to the non-individual HRTF.},
