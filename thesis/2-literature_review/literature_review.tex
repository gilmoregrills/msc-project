\subsection{Modifying HRTFs/Overview}
This idea of generating individualised sets of HRTFs without having to perform the complex measurements that would usually be required has existed since the 1990s \citep{Kulkarni1995}. The ideal scenario for commonplace spatial audio involves every user having access to an HRTF set that works for them. If traditional methods of measurements are impractical, then alternatives are necessary.

\subsection{Methods}
Investigations into HRTF individualisation have been done using a range methodologies, some involving just simple selection tasks and others complex tuning - adjusting multiple parameters against listening tests. Often these methods hinge on a specific model that is used to decompose the HRTF into individual parameters that can be manipulated independently in order to achieve meaningful control over the customisation process. In some cases these models also seek to make clear the relationship between the features of the HRTF and the features of the user - the morphological properties of the measuree being the primary determinant of generated HRIR this seems a logical approach. In these next few sections I will cover the main of the approaches that have been investigated to date, as well as their efficacy and why they are or are not well suited to this project.
